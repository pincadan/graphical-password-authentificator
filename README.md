# Here's a simple graphical password authentificator implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for educational purposes:

This code creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for a password authenticator. It includes an entry field for entering a password, a "Check" button to verify the entered password against the generated password, and a "Generate" button to generate a new random password.

The PasswordAuthenticator class is responsible for creating the GUI components and handling the user interactions. The check_password method compares the entered password with the generated password and updates the result label accordingly. The generate_password method generates a new random password and updates the password entry field.

The generate_random_password method generates a random password by selecting random characters from a predefined set of characters.

To run the code, you need to have Python installed along with the Tkinter library. You can run the script in a Python environment and a GUI window will appear, allowing you to interact with the password authenticator.

Note: This code is for educational purposes and should not be used in a production environment without further security enhancements.
